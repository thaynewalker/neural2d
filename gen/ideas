Once they've been trained, neural networks can recognize patterns, giving predictions and/or classifying observations.

Example:
We want to detect whether a situation is "normal"; e.g. are entities in the space acting like they usually act? Or are they doing something different today?

- Tip of the iceberg - Are the positions of entities on the map "normal"? Is the spectrum today "normal"?

This can possibly be done by training a neural net with "normal" everyday traffic, spectrum, etc. and then give it a "new" situation to analyze. It should be able to give us an estimate of "normalcy".

- Classifying a situation

Suppose we train a neural net with instances of pre-labeled scenarios: "normal", "heightened", "threatening".

If we present the net with a situation, it should be able to give us an estimate of the situation. "60% normal, 39% heightened, 1% threatening."

An example is caffe: http://demo.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/classify_url?imageurl=http%3A%2F%2Fi.telegraph.co.uk%2Fmultimedia%2Farchive%2F02351%2Fcross-eyed-cat_2351472k.jpg

We perhaps could use their open source neural net to classify data-refined situations instead of images...
